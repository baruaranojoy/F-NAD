Content :When a beloved character leaves a show it can be devastating./*~*/As of late, one of the most common methods of creating drama and cliffhangers is by killing a fan-favorite character./*~*/This has become apparent, more than anywhere else, on my favorite show, Talking Dead./*~*/This trend dates back to the original shocking death, Jon Bernthal./*~*/He would give these amazing anecdotes, so engrossing, even Chris Hardwick couldn’t get a word in, and that guy always had something to say./*~*/One time, Bernthal was talking about getting nervous about shaving his head./*~*/He flipped things around and started asking Hardwick questions about wedding plans./*~*/Like, for real, do I need to hear about the time Andrew Lincoln’s old theater group went on a retreat to Hawaii and did Shakespeare inside a live volcano?/*~*/Damn Andrew, how did you fit a suit on over all that PLOT ARMOR./*~*/Plus, then he’d be free to devote more time to his new AMC show: Talking Ride with Norman Reedus./*~*/
