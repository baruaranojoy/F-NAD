Content :The Garda Síochána (Irish police) was called on the site early this morning, after some neighbors complained about the smell emanating from his room./*~*/Mr Alexander had attracted a lot of attention from the British public and media in 2014, when he published his book entitled “ The real Prince Harry: The truth behind the Royal lies “./*~*/In this book, he claimed to be the real son of Princess Diana, saying that he was replaced by a look-alike at Queen Elizabeth’s demand when he was 8-years old, after he threatened to reveal that Prince Charles was not his biological father./*~*/He says that he was awoken at night by his father’s butler and driven to Lincolnshire, where he was exchanged with the son of Lord Edward James Alexander, who had his age and also the particularity of looking a lot like him./*~*/His claims had received some intense coverage for a while from the British tabloids, but then had suddenly disappeared from the media after a few days, generating rumors of cover-up among conspiracy theorists./*~*/The young author had then accused the Royal family of pressuring his publisher and his editor, in order to have his book taken off the shelves./*~*/An encounter between Mr Alexander and Prince Charles at the 2014 London Book Fair had resulted in a rather digraceful scene, as the heir to the British throne called the young man “a little bastard”, before telling him to “leave his family alone”./*~*/Mr Alexander fled England in January 2015 and sought asylum in Ireland, saying that he was being followed and harassed by the MI5 and that he had received multiple death threats by extremist supporters of the British monarchy./*~*/Some sources close to the young man, told The Daily Beast that he had recently had contacts with the British embassy concerning an eventual return to England, and that he even had dinner with an attaché of the embassy at the end of the month of March, probably less than 24 hours before he was killed./*~*/Despite these shocking coincidences, the police refuses for the moment, to link the British embassy or secret services to Mr Alexander’s death, saying that they are “following every possible lead” that could help them solve the case./*~*/
