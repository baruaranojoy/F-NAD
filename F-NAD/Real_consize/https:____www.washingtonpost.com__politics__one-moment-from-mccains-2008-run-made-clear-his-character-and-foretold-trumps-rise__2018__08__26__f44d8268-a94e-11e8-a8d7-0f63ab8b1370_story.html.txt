Content :It was both the most memorable moment from John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign and a glimpse into the future of the Republican Party and America’s angry and divisive modern-day politics./*~*/Played and replayed constantly since the senator’s death on Saturday at age 81, the moment seems to presage the rise of the “birther movement,” the era of “alternative facts,” and the presidency of Donald Trump less than a decade later./*~*/At a high school about 30 miles south of Minneapolis, a blond woman in a red shirt addresses McCain, who is in the final weeks of what will be his second failed run for the White House./*~*/Shortly after he had secured his party’s nomination, the senator proposed a barnstorming series of nine debates with his Democratic opponent around the country./*~*/The advertisement, combined with the increasing likelihood of an Obama victory, had unleashed the torrent of Republican anger that Palin helped stoke./*~*/At a rally in Florida she had whipped up supporters by telling them that Obama liked to “pal around” with “urban terrorists,” prompting a person in the crowd to shout “Kill him!”/*~*/“I don’t care about old washed-up terrorists,” he said at the rally, and instead suggested that the real question was whether Obama had lied about the extent of his relationship with Ayers./*~*/Quinnell was parodied on “Saturday Night Live” a few days later in a skit that featured a crazed McCain-Palin supporter wandering through the “Weekend Update” set and proclaiming that Obama was “50 percent Egyptian./*~*/Quinnell’s daughter told reporters that her mother did not have access to the Internet and had read that Obama was a Muslim during a visit to the library./*~*/Trump would first become a leading champion of the “birther” conspiracy, which played on suspicions about Obama to suggest incorrectly that he was not born in the United States./*~*/
