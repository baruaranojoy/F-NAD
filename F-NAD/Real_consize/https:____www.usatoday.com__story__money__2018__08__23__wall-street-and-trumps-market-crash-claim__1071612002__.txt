Content :But Wall Street begs to differ, arguing that the forces driving the nearly $30 trillion U.S. stock market are far bigger and stronger than the influence of one person, even one as powerful as the nation's commander in chief./*~*/Perkin and other Wall Street pros don't dispute that the president's growth-friendly policies, like lower taxes and fewer business regulations, have provided a lift to the economy and stock market since he entered the White House./*~*/But money managers stress that the stock market's longer-term direction and health are less about political drama and more about the overall strength of America's economy and other factors, such as the level of interest rates, oil prices, corporate profits and consumer spending./*~*/The economy is so juiced on stimulus from tax cuts and low borrowing costs that investors can expect solid growth despite political shake-ups, analysts say./*~*/"It would be unfair to dismiss the influence of politics altogether," Oliver Jones, a markets economist at Capital Economics, a London-based firm, wrote in a report./*~*/Trump's strong base and support from Republicans make it unlikely, even if Democrats begin impeachment proceedings, that the Senate will be able to come up with the two-thirds vote to convict him, analysts say./*~*/Wall Street has been warily eyeing the president's troubles for months, so a possible impeachment proceeding wouldn't come as a surprise â€“ nor would it be enough to lead to an economic downturn, says Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG, a Tokyo-based global bank with offices in New York./*~*/At the moment, "the only outcomes that could cause a crash would be extreme (interest rate) tightening by the Fed, which is unlikely, signs of a recession, which is not imminent, (or) a major trade war, which is possible but not likely," says Greg Valliere, chief global strategist and Washington policy expert at Horizon Investments./*~*/The stock market rose nearly 30 percent in the 14-month span when Clinton was embroiled in the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal and other legal issues, leading to his impeachment trial./*~*/For Trump's crash prediction to come true, one would have to conclude that the president was 100 percent responsible for the surge in stock prices that Wilshire Associates says has created paper profits of nearly $7 trillion since he entered the White House./*~*/
